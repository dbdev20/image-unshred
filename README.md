# image-unshred
This Mathematica notebook unshreds shredded images using an edge-matching method and sorting algorithm.

It can be used to solve puzzles in which an image has been shredded, as if through a paper shredder, into vertical slices, and each slice has been arbitrarily flipped.

A slightly modified version of this problem was the final project for ECE 533, Image Processing, at UW-Madison, in the Fall 2023 semester.

I have generalized it to work for any image and any arbitrary number of shreds.
